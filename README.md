# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This repository contains all files relating to the week 3 front end coding bootcamp challenge of recreating a portfolio website using Bootstrap. I was motivated to complete this project because I wanted to learn to apply Bootstrap and appreciate the benefits that Bootstrap offers in terms of standardising content. This website showcases projects I've worked on to potential employers and highlights the skills that I plan to have developed on completion of the bootcamp. Through completing the project, I learnt how to apply Bootstrap, in particular I learnt how to customise Bootstrap's navigation bars and jumbotron to reflect my own personal style. This project also gave me the opportunity to apply CSS effects such as changing styles on hovering.
